# neural-net
A simple neural network written in c++

# Getting Started
Follow this instructions in order to set up a copy of this project in your machine.

## Prerequisites
There are only two prerequisites for this project: A compiler with support for *c++11* standard or later, and the [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library headers where the source code can read in your system.

## Installing
In order to set up *Eigen*, you can either follow [these](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/GettingStarted.html) instructions, or copy the headers to where your system stores its c++ libraries, which is usually in */usr/local/include* or */usr/include*. After you have Eigen set up, just change your working directory to the project root and type *make*. After the compilation process concludes, you shall have everything ready. Just use *./main* to test the program.

```
cd neural-net
make
./main
```

# Built With
